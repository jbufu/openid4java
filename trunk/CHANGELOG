Notable changes since the previous release:

HttpClient upgraded to 4.0.
HttpClient is injectable, making Google AppEngine deployments possible.
HttpCache supports configurable TTL.
Attribute Exchange extension parameters are required to be signed.
Java 1.5 for source and distributed bytecode.

And a handful of bug fixes.

official release in November 2007, and are supported by OpenID4Java:

Under the hood:

* discovery HTTP requests are transparently cached for increased performance
* a minimal set of library dependencies are packaged with the official release
* alternative packages are released with optional / extra functionality
* proxy XRI resolver delegating to the service provided by XRI.net
* local XRI resolver updated to use the latest openXRI 1.2.0 library
* JDBC implementations for nonces and associations stores
